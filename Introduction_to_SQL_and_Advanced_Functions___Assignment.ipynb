        "commands in SQL. Provide one example for each type of command.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: DDL, DML, and DQL are distinct categories of SQL commands serving different purposes in database management.\n",
        "1. DDL (Data Definition Language):\n",
        "Purpose: DDL commands are used to define, modify, and delete the structure of database objects (like tables, views, indexes, schemas). They deal with the schema or structure of the database, not the data itself.\n",
        "Impact: Changes made by DDL commands are permanent and automatically committed. They cannot be rolled back.\n",
        "Example: Creating a new table.\n",
        "Code\n",
        "\n",
        "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",

        "    Age INT\n",
        ");\n",
        "2. DML (Data Manipulation Language):\n",
        "Purpose: DML commands are used to manipulate the data within the database objects. They allow users to insert, update, or delete records in tables.\n",
        "Impact: Changes made by DML commands are not automatically committed and can be rolled back using transaction control commands (like ROLLBACK).\n",

        "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Smith', 20);\n",
        "3. DQL (Data Query Language):\n",
        "Purpose: DQL commands are used to retrieve data from the database. They allow users to query and fetch specific information based on defined criteria.\n",
        "Impact: DQL commands do not modify the database structure or the data itself; they only retrieve information.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer: SQL constraints are rules applied to columns or tables in a database to enforce data integrity and maintain data accuracy and reliability. They ensure that data entered into the database adheres to specific criteria, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being stored.\n",
        "Here are three common types of constraints:\n",
        "PRIMARY KEY Constraint:\n",
        "Description: A PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique for each row. A table can only have one PRIMARY KEY.\n",
        "Scenario: In a Customers table, the CustomerID column would typically be designated as the PRIMARY KEY. This ensures that every customer record is uniquely identifiable and that no two customers have the same CustomerID.\n",
        "FOREIGN KEY Constraint:\n",
        "Description: A FOREIGN KEY establishes a link between two tables. It refers to the PRIMARY KEY of another table, ensuring referential integrity by preventing actions that would destroy the links between tables.\n",
        "Scenario: In an Orders table, the CustomerID column could be a FOREIGN KEY referencing the CustomerID (PRIMARY KEY) in the Customers table. This ensures that an order can only be placed by an existing customer and prevents the deletion of a customer record if there are associated orders.\n",
        "NOT NULL Constraint:\n",
        "Description: The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. Every row must have a value in that specific column.\n",
        "Scenario: In a Products table, the ProductName column would likely have a NOT NULL constraint. This ensures that every product entered into the database has a name, preventing records with missing product names."

        "has 10 records?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in SQL are used to control the number of rows returned by a query and the starting point of those rows within the result set.\n",
        "LIMIT: This clause restricts the maximum number of rows returned by a query. It specifies how many rows to include in the final result. For example, LIMIT 10 would return only the first 10 rows.\n",
        "OFFSET: This clause specifies the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the result set before starting to return rows. It effectively \"offsets\" the starting point of the result. For example, OFFSET 20 would skip the first 20 rows and start returning results from the 21st row.\n",
        "Using LIMIT and OFFSET for Pagination (Third Page of Results with 10 Records per Page):\n",
        "To retrieve the third page of results, assuming each page has 10 records, the following SQL query structure can be used:\n",

        "LIMIT 10\n",
        "OFFSET 20;\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "ORDER BY your_column_for_ordering: This is crucial for consistent pagination. Without an ORDER BY clause, the order of rows returned by the database is not guaranteed, meaning the \"third page\" could contain different records each time the query is executed. Replace your_column_for_ordering with the column(s) you want to use to sort your results (e.g., id, creation_date).\n",
        "LIMIT 10: This specifies that only 10 records should be returned, which corresponds to the number of records on a single page.\n",
        "OFFSET 20: To get the third page, you need to skip the records from the first two pages. Since each page has 10 records, the first two pages contain 2 * 10 = 20 records. Therefore, OFFSET 20 skips these initial 20 records, and the LIMIT 10 then retrieves the next 10 records, which constitute the third page.\n",

        "benefits? Provide a simple SQL example demonstrating its usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary, named result set that you can define within the execution scope of a single SQL statement (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE). It functions as a virtual table, created and used only for the duration of the query, and not stored permanently in the database. CTEs are initiated using the WITH clause.\n",
        "Main Benefits of CTEs:\n",
        "Improved Readability and Maintainability: CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, more logical, and understandable blocks. This modular approach makes the SQL code easier to read, debug, and maintain, especially in collaborative environments.\n",
        "Reusability: You can define a CTE once and reference it multiple times within the same query, avoiding the repetition of subqueries and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
        "Support for Recursive Queries: CTEs are essential for handling hierarchical or tree-structured data by enabling recursive queries, where a CTE can reference itself to traverse through levels of a hierarchy (e.g., organizational charts, bill of materials).\n",
        "Enhanced Organization: By separating complex logic into distinct CTEs, you can better organize your SQL statements, making the flow of data transformations more transparent.\n",
        "Simple SQL Example Demonstrating CTE Usage:\n",
        "Consider a table named Employees with columns EmployeeID, Name, Department, and Salary. We want to find the average salary per department and then list all employees whose salary is above their department's average.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: SQL Normalization is a database design technique used to organize tables and columns to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. Its primary goals are:\n",
        "Eliminate Data Redundancy: Reduce the storage of duplicate information, which saves space and prevents inconsistencies when data is updated.\n",
        "Improve Data Integrity: Ensure the accuracy and consistency of data by establishing clear relationships and dependencies between data elements.\n",

        "Each column must contain atomic values, meaning there are no repeating groups or multi-valued attributes within a single cell.\n",
        "Each column must have a unique name.\n",
        "Second Normal Form (2NF):\n",
        "The table must already be in 1NF.\n",
        "All non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. This means that if a table has a composite primary key, no non-key attribute can depend on only a part of that primary key.\n",
        "Third Normal Form (3NF):\n",
        "The table must already be in 2NF.\n",
        "There should be no transitive dependencies. This means that no non-key attribute should be functionally dependent on another non-key attribute. In other words, all non-key attributes must directly depend on the primary key, and not indirectly through another non-key attribute."

        "\n",
        "Answer: To generate the report, you can use an SQL query that performs a LEFT JOIN between the Customers and Orders tables and then uses the COUNT and COALESCE (or ISNULL) aggregate functions. This approach ensures all customers are included, even those with no corresponding orders.\n",
        "Prerequisites\n",
        "This query assumes you have two tables, likely named Customers and Orders, with the following relevant columns:\n",
        "Customers table: CustomerID, CustomerName, Email\n",
        "Orders table: OrderID, CustomerID (foreign key)\n",

        "ORDER BY\n",
        "    c.CustomerName;\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation\n",
        "LEFT JOIN: This is crucial. It returns all records from the left table (Customers) and the matching records from the right table (Orders). For customers without orders, the Orders columns will be NULL.\n",
        "COUNT(o.OrderID): This aggregate function counts the non-NULL OrderID values for each group of customers. Customers without orders will have a count of 0 because COUNT() ignores NULL values.\n",
        "COALESCE(COUNT(o.OrderID), 0): In some SQL dialects (like SQL Server), the COUNT might return NULL for no matches; COALESCE replaces any NULL result with 0 for the TotalNumberofOrders column. (In many modern SQL versions, the COUNT() function automatically handles this, but COALESCE is a safe, standard practice).\n",
        "GROUP BY: Since you are using an aggregate function (COUNT()) along with non-aggregated columns (CustomerName, Email), you must include the non-aggregated columns in the GROUP BY clause. Grouping by the primary key (CustomerID) is a best practice to ensure uniqueness even if names are duplicated.\n",
        "ORDER BY: This sorts the final result set by CustomerName in ascending order as requested."
